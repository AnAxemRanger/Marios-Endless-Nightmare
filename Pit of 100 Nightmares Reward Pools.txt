In the Pit of 100 Nightmares game mode, each floor has two statues.
The left statue lets you sacrifice 9 frog coins in exchange for a
reward.  The right statue lets you sacrifice an amount of regular
coins for a reward, where the price depends on the type of reward
offered and how deep in the Pit you are.  The prize pools for the
various randomized rewards are outlined here.
