The Story
*********
After thwarting their plans to conquer Mario's world, the denizens of
the Weapon World that Smithy came from fight back!  Three sorcerers
from the Weapon World have invaded Mario's dreams!  They've placed a
curse on him to keep him asleep forever.  The only way for Mario to
break this curse is to find these sorceres and defeat them!

Here's some basic info in FAQ form
**********************************
Q. What is this?
A. This is a romhack/hack/mod of Super Mario RPG (SNES).

Q. What does this mod change?
A. Most of the overworld has been removed.  All that's left is stuff
like shops, a bed, and a save point.  This is a mod that
focuses primarily on battling.  The point of this hack is to fight
your way through various waves of enemies until you beat it.  There's
not a lot of exploration or story.

Q. What's the gameplay like?
A. There are two main game modes:
-The main campaign.  You'll fight through various groups of enemies
and bosses that mirror the progression of the original game.  In
between batches of foes, you'll have to opportunity to save, heal,
and shop.  You can replay any battle rooms you've previously cleared,
so grinding for additional resources is an option.  You could even
choose not to recruit any additional allies if you wanted.
-The Pit of 100 Nightmares.  Fight your way through 100 floors of
battles while experiencing roguelike elements, such as randomly added
allies, paying for random items and equipment, and random groups of
enemies (that still follow a progression that makes sense).

Q. What's the difficulty like?
A. The main campaign is as hard as you make it.  If you choose to
only do each battle room once, you'll likely start feeling
underleveled around area 5 or 6.  But again, grinding for levels and
coins is an option.  Since permanent stat boosters can be purchased
with Frog Coins, you can make yourself as strong as you want.
The Pit of 100 Nightmares is the "hard mode" of this hack.  Since
grinding isn't an option, you'll likely feel underpowered as you
progress.  Add the fact that various prizes are randomized, you
could get unlucky and end up with a bad load out.  This game mode is
not for the faint of heart!

Q. What are the notable features?
A. The main campaign includes:
-an optional Pit of 100 Trials (different from the Pit of 100
Nightmares).
-The ability to switch ALL allies, including Mario.
-The ability to choose the song that plays in battle.
-New items that permanently boost ally stats.
-New equipment with various abilities.
-New enemies, including rare enemies that drop Frog Coins.

Q. Don't some bosses require 3 allies in your party to work?
A. This game will check how many playable characters are on your team
for certain boss fights.  Fights like Bundt that are only beatable
with more than 1 ally will have an alternate version to battle so
that the game is still beatable.

As a fun side note, Johnny will not challenge you to a 1 V 1 unless
you have a team of three in battle.  If you do, Johnny will challenge
whoever is in the first slot to a 1 V 1 so plan carefully!

Q. How do I play it?
A. You must apply this .ips patch to a clean ROM of the US version of
Super Mario RPG.  I cannot provide you this ROM.

Q. I found a game breaking error!
A. Please report it to me.  I can't guarantee I'll fix everything,
but I'll certainly fix what I can.
